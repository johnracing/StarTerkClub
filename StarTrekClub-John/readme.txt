/*  Project 2: Information Technology Year 2
 *  Subject: Programming Fundamentals 2
 * 	Author: John Burke; 
 *  Student ID: 20079132
 *  
 * 	This project demonstrates GUI usage, JOptionPane for error reporting,
 *  LinkedList of Objects of class Members for a fan club for Star Trek.
 
 *  Sound is included on the buttons.
 
 *  'X' for termination on the main menu is deactivated so one must
 *  click the exit option on the menu.
 
 *  The project also saves the members into a text file and retrieves it 
 * 	so the member list is not lost when the computer stops.
 * 
 * 
 * 	*******   Bugs: On view member details page, for individual selection,
 *  the last member cannot be seen. It is stored and can be edited, 
 *  by trying 'all' it can be seen.
 *  if txt file is empty, the application reports error, however it does save correctly and therefore no 
 *  error reported after that as list is no longer empty.
